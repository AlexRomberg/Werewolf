# Werewolf Companion App üê∫

This Project is a try to assist the narrator of the game werewolf ("Die Werw√∂lfe von D√ºsterwald"). So they can fully focus on storry telling.

## How it works
As the narrator of a werewolf session you need the physical game. Have your group sitting in a circle.  
This companion app now helps you keep track of all the roles, and in which state the players are (e.g. Who is a couple, who has which function, who is protected this night, ...)  
It also lists you the roles that are active this night, with a small description.

## How to use it
- Goto https://wolf.aro-playground.ch/
- Select all the cards you have in the game.
- Set the number of people
- Press start
- Play
  - The highlighted item on the side is your current task/active role.
  - If there is something you have to do with the role there will be a button on its card.
  - When you need to correct something or want to put a name on someone in the visualization press on the person in the circle.

### A note about Spotify
I tried to add the playlist I commonly use in the game in a interactive way. While it works mostly it breaks quite quickly. 

## Current state
Work in progress:
- The game does not fully save your state.
- The UI is currently just in german.
- You cannot update connections.
