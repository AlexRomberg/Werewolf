# Werewolf Companion App üê∫

This Project is a try to assist the narrator of the game werewolf / "Die Werw√∂lfe von D√ºsterwald". So they can fully focus on storry telling.

## How it works
As the narrator of a werewolf session you need the physical game. Have your group sitting in a circle.  
This companion app now helps you keep track of all the roles, and in which state the players are (e.g. Who is a couple, who has which function, who is protected this night)  
It also lists you the roles that are active this night.

## Current state
Work in progress:
- The first couple of visualisations are working but you can only run the first night with some characters.
